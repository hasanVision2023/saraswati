                        <p align="justify">Project management ties together all activities on a project. A project may be well conceived & adequately financed, the contracts may be carefully drawn up, the contractors & workers highly experienced. But if all aspects of the project are not expertly integrated and managed, it may overrun the budget, fail to meet the schedule, or fall short in technical quality. <span  style="color: #757575 !important;font-weight: bold;"> Saraswati Group,</span> with experience of construction jobs undertaken. Using a proprietary process called KASETM, we verify readiness to proceed at key project milestones. KASE stands for key activities for successful execution. By means of KASE and all the rest of Saraswati Group project management tools, systems, and processes, we know how to manage all aspects of even the most complex project, from engineering and procurement to construction and completion. We also are experts at resolving conflicts and identifying issues before they become problems. Our teams focus on the overall picture, establishing priorities and coordinating activities and participants to ensure quality projects that are delivered safely, on time, and within budget. As the construction manager on a project, <span  style="color: #757575 !important;font-weight: bold;"> Saraswati Group </span> secures labor through carefully selected subcontractors that have a proven history of safety performance, execution excellence, and commercial success.</p>

                      <p align="justify"><span style="color: #757575 !important;font-weight: bold;">Saraswati Group </span> quality management systems continually assess our processes to enhance project outcome for our customers. Whether it's working on first-of-a-kind technical solutions or building in complex environments, we get the job done right. For 25 years, customers have placed their confidence in <br> <span style="color: #757575 !important;font-weight: bold;"> Saraswati Group </span> ability to manage projects in which they have substantial investments. It’s a commitment we’re proud of and one that’s been substantiated by customer loyalty.</p>
                      <p  align="justify"><span style="color: #757575 !important;font-weight: bold;"> Quality from end to end</span> <br><span style="color: #757575 !important;font-weight: bold;">Saraswati Group</span> continuously reassesses its quality management system to make sure our work is done right the first time, every time. Maintaining that level of quality is all about improving our processes; strengthening our culture; and emphasizing individual performance, accountability, and recognition. As with most businesses, our core processes of management,procurement, and construction cross many functional boundaries.
                        To bridge any gaps that may emerge during project core process integration, we have recently aligned our quality and Six Sigma efforts. For example, we know that careful planning early in the project lifecycle—when key decisions are made about the work plan—will yield the greatest reduction in rework and improvements in quality. Essentially, our projects head off rework by enlisting the support of our construction and procurement teams as part of the early design process, and continue this collaboration throughout commissioning.

Saraswati Group evaluates essential activities on each project to mitigate risk in advance of deploying vital resources. Our Project Managers & coordinators keep our functions aligned to ensure seamless integration of critical work products. Six Sigma is also a powerful tool for Saraswati Group. Originally developed to improve quality in manufacturing operations, we adopted this business management capability as a part of a greater strategy to improve processes continuously in every corner of our management, procurement, and construction functions. This has benefited our customers through increased project efficiency; identification of innovative solutions; and cost savings.
                            In addition we are enhancing our quality culture by engaging employees earlier in their careers – providing greater personal responsibility, institutional support, skills, and training. This is also coupled with recognition efforts that empower our employees to “own” the quality of their work and exceed customer expectations. As they expand their skills through advanced learning, our people enjoy institutional support through new opportunities and recognition of the pride that is built into their work. This in turn helps us develop a wider pool of talent who will carry their personal quality commitment forward to their next project or position.</p>

Saraswati Group has earned an record of achieving zero lost-time incidents on projects. Year after year, our zero accidents philosophy helps put our safety performance right at the top At Saraswati Group, we believe that every accident, and therefore every injury, is preventable, and we embed that philosophy into every Saraswati Group project through a combination of technical field procedures and ongoing training programs. Every employee has stop-work authority—if it's not safe, don't do it. We also ask our subcontractors and partners to adopt our commitment to safety and health. The result is exceptional safety performance, even in hazardous work environments, severe weather, and remote locations. Our dedication to safety helps keep workers safe, and it also pays off for our customers. Their operating costs go down and productivity goes up because less time is lost to accidents. And our people go home to their families safely at the end of each day.</p>
